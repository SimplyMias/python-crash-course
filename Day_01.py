#Installed Python in my PC
#print("Hello World")
#When you run the file hello_world.py, the ending .py indicates that the
# file is a Python program. Your editor then runs the file through the
# Python interpreter, which reads through the program and determines
# what each word in the program means.

#Syntax Highlighting
# As we write programs, code editor highlights different parts of your program in different ways

#Variables
# message = "Hello World"
#We’ve added a variable named message
# print(message)
# A variable is a name that refers to a value.
# The value is the actual data stored and associated with that variable.
# In our case value is "Hello World"
#Adding a variable makes a little more work for the Python
# interpreter. When it processes the first line, it associates the variable
# message with the "Hello Python world!" text. When it reaches the second
# line, it prints the value associated with message to the screen.
# message = "This is my first program"
# print(message)
# You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time,
# and Python will always keep track of its current value.

# Naming a Variable
# 1. Variable names can only contain letters numbers and underscores and they  cannot start with a number
# 2. Spaces are not allowed in variable names
# 3. Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names
# 4. Variable name should be short but descriptive
